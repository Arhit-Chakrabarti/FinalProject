#' @param x0 a vector of starting values for the components of the intervention package
#' @param lower a vector providing the values of lower limits for the components of the intervention package
#' @param upper a vector providing the values of upper limits for the components of the intervention package
#' @param nstages the number of stages of the LAGO design K (>=2)
#' @param centers a vector of length nstages providing the number of centers at the different stages of the LAGO design
#' @param beta.true a vector of true i.e. population beta values
#' @param sample.size sample size (n) in each center of each of the K stages
#' @param icc the expected variation among subjects within each centers at any stage
#' @param bcc the expected variation between the centers at any stage while implementing the intervention package
#' @param cost.vec a vector of per unit linear cost coefficients
#' @param prob the desired outcome goal
#' @param intercept a logical argument to include intercept in the model or not (default = TRUE)
#' @param B the number of simulations (default = 100)
#'
#' @return This function returns a named list containing 'xopt' and 'p.opt.hat'. 'xopt' contains the stage-wise estimated optimum intervention package obtained by considering the median over the given number of simulations. 'p.opt.hat' returns the stage-wise estimated success probabilities, i.e. the success probabilities corresponding to the estimated optimal intervention package by considering the median over simulations.
